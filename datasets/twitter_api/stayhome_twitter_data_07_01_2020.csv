"@TonyBN3 @123BruceLee7 @ShaunLintern @SepsisUK No. It’s not a joke. Working 12-16 hour shifts while infected will not help staff to recover. You need a well rested immune system to do that. 

I think they have sacrificed enough already. Covid infected staff deserve time off to recover. Sick leave is a right.
