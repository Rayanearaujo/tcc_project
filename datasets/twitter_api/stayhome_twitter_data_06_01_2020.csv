Last time we had a lockdown in March, I was deemed essential and still commuted to work. I saw barely any other cars let alone people. This time around, traffic, traffic, traffic. Where the hell are you all going? And better yet, why? #StayHome|2021-01-06 00:20:38

EVERY SINGLE TEACHER wants your child happy, healthy &amp; educated. That‚Äôs pretty obvious, or we wouldn‚Äôt be teachers.
