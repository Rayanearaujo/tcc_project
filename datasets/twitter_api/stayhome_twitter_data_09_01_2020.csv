@BorisJohnson You're finally conveying the correct message but you and your cronies have lost the respect of the people (what little you had), so it's largely being ignored. Announce that you'll resign at the end of lockdown if people start complying, that should do it. #StayHome|2021-01-09 14:28:09

Yet @BorisJohnson gives us a glorified Tier 4, click and collect, takeaways, garden centres and leaves many other non-essential businesses open as normal.
